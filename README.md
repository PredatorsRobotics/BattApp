Predators Robotics: BattApp
===========================

#### About BattApp ####

BattApp is the Predators Robotics' custom-developed battery-management
solution for keeping track of the status of FRC Batteries used for
competition. It allows QR Codes on the batteries to be scanned to
indicate whether the battery is charged or not, who used or charged it
last, and how old the battery is, among many other data.

BattApp also includes an admin panel to allow for the addition and
removal of a team's users, batteries, and QR codes, and includes a
secure login and email reminders and succinct summaries.
